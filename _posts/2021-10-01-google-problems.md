Is it just me, or have the quality of Google's search results
declined? These days, whether I'm searching for recommendations for
React date-pickers or parenting tips for toddlers, all I seem to get
are spammy, SEO-optimised, low signal, click-bait in my results.

These sites only seem to exist to detect that you're interested in a
topic in order to better target you for advertising.

From a design perspective, it makes me think about the long term of
consequences of who you think your stakeholders are.

Once, if you had something to say, or a helpful tip, you would publish
it on a blog, where it could be picked up by a search engine.

This method of self-publishing was made usable by Google Reader.

By ending support for Google Reader, did Google push *real* user
generated content into the walled gardens of Twitter or Instagram?

By facilitating user-tracking across the web, did Google incubate
these click-farms?

Have they poisoned their own well?
